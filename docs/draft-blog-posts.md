## Record Design Decisions

After reading the constraints in the previous sections, and if you're coming from a dynamic language background, you might be wondering why one would bother with record in the first place instead of imitating JS and use a catch-all object concept for everything.

The reason is that JavaScript objects can be _really_ slow. Some code might add fieds, remove fields, iterate over them, pass the keys themselves somewhere else, etc. The JS engines nowadays try to "guess" your object's usage patterns and sometime optimize that into a solid C++ struct, but some other time fail to do so and convert your overly dynamic object into a hash map, with a sudden >100x performance degradation (imagine an object field access needing to hash the key and traverse the hashmap to find it).

We love simplicify, but a single all-powerful data structure that is the JS object is a bit too naive. This is why Reason separates the above use-cases into record, and proper hashmap (documented later). This way, you get to leverage the consistently fast record experience, like in the above immutable update section. Field access is also guaranteed to be super fast.

"But doesn't a Reason record compile to a JS object anyway"? Yes, but those records will trigger the JS engines' optimistic object optimizations, since they see that you never tried to e.g. add or remove record fields, iterate through the keys, etc., and therefore they'll never transform your those compiled JS objects into C++ hash maps or other slow data structures. Basically, Reason's type system enforced the disciplined usage of this data structure so that you can guarantee that it will never be accidentally slow.

(And yes, we're aware that it's comical for a language feature to transform into a dynamic-looking JS object, then transformed again by the JS engines into a C++ struct, then end up where we started in the first place. Such is modern engineering.)
